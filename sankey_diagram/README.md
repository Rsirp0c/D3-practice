This is a sankey diagram used as an example in the book [D3 Tips and Tricks v4](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4). It is based on a [simpler version here](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/013054e8d7807dff76247b81b0e29030).

It demonstrates the construction of a [sankey diagram](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/) using d3.js from external csv data that is formatted using just link data and named values.
